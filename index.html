      <p>“Bottom of the sixth. Ray Burris, lined up and first pitches the ball in - too close.<br>
      Koosman allowed a walk and a hitter but rounded up the third innings to retire the side; Burris put down the Mets in order in the first three innings.<br>
      Here's a swing! and a bouncing ball to Manni Trillo and he's got Koosman just jogging down the line. And he's out by several steps.<br>
      Lenny Randle up next... and the lights have just gone off here at Shea Stadium!”</p>
